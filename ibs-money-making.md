Investment banks make money through several key strategies and revenue streams:

1. Advisory Services:
- Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) advisory: Investment banks advise companies on mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, earning significant fees for these complex transactions[1][7].
- Restructuring advisory: They help companies reorganize their finances or operations, especially during financial distress[1].

2. Underwriting:
- Equity underwriting: Investment banks help companies raise capital by issuing stocks through IPOs or secondary offerings[1][7].
- Debt underwriting: They assist in issuing bonds and other debt securities for corporations and governments[1][7].

3. Trading and Sales:
- Market making: Investment banks provide liquidity in various financial markets, earning from the bid-ask spread[1][5].
- Proprietary trading: Some banks trade with their own capital to generate profits, though this has been limited by regulations in recent years[1].

4. Asset Management:
- Investment banks manage assets for institutional clients and high-net-worth individuals, earning fees based on the assets under management[1][7].

5. Research:
- Investment banks provide research on companies, industries, and markets, which supports their other business lines and can be sold to clients[1][7].

6. Lending:
- Corporate lending: Some investment banks offer loans to corporate clients, often in conjunction with other services[7].

Key strategies employed by top investment banks:

1. Global presence: Banks like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley maintain a strong global presence to serve clients worldwide[4][7].

2. Diversification: Top banks offer a wide range of services to reduce reliance on any single revenue stream[7].

3. Technology adoption: Investment in AI, blockchain, and other technologies to improve efficiency and offer new services[11].

4. Focus on ESG and sustainable finance: Banks are increasingly prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in their strategies[11].

5. Talent acquisition and retention: Banks invest heavily in recruiting and retaining top talent, often from prestigious universities[6].

6. Client relationships: Building and maintaining strong relationships with corporate clients is crucial for securing repeat business[7].

7. Risk management: Sophisticated risk management practices are employed to navigate complex financial markets[7].

8. Regulatory compliance: Adapting to and efficiently managing increasingly complex regulatory requirements[11].

Investment banks can employ many people due to:

1. The complex nature of their work, requiring specialized skills in finance, law, technology, and other areas[6].
2. The need for extensive research and analysis to support their advisory and trading activities[7].
3. The global scale of their operations, requiring staff in multiple locations[4].
4. The high-touch nature of their client relationships, necessitating dedicated teams for each major client or transaction[7].

By leveraging these strategies and revenue streams, top investment banks generate substantial income, allowing them to maintain large, highly-skilled workforces and compete in the global financial markets.
