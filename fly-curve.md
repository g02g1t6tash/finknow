A fly (or butterfly) spread and a curve spread are both strategies involving interest rate swaps (IRS) that are used to speculate on or hedge against changes in the shape of the yield curve. Here's an overview of how each strategy works:

### Fly (Butterfly) Spread

A butterfly spread involves entering into a combination of interest rate swaps to take advantage of changes in the curvature of the yield curve. It typically involves three legs:

1. **Two outer legs:** Enter into two interest rate swaps with different maturities (one shorter-term and one longer-term).
2. **One inner leg:** Enter into a third interest rate swap with a maturity that is approximately the average of the two outer legs.

The idea is to profit from the changes in the relative pricing of these swaps as the yield curve changes shape. 

- **If the curve steepens:** The rates on the outer legs (long and short maturities) will diverge more significantly than the rate on the inner leg (medium maturity).
- **If the curve flattens:** The rates on the outer legs will converge more significantly than the rate on the inner leg.

A butterfly spread can be either:
- **Long butterfly spread:** Benefit from a curve becoming more pronounced (curvier).
- **Short butterfly spread:** Benefit from the curve becoming flatter.

### Example:

- **Short leg (A):** 2-year swap
- **Medium leg (B):** 5-year swap
- **Long leg (C):** 10-year swap

A long butterfly spread involves:
- Receiving the fixed rate on two 2-year swaps (A)
- Paying the fixed rate on one 5-year swap (B)
- Receiving the fixed rate on one 10-year swap (C)

### Curve Spread

A curve spread involves taking positions in two interest rate swaps with different maturities to bet on the direction of the yield curve's slope.

- **Steepener:** This involves paying fixed on a shorter-term swap and receiving fixed on a longer-term swap. This position benefits if the yield curve steepens (i.e., long-term rates rise relative to short-term rates).
  
- **Flattener:** This involves receiving fixed on a shorter-term swap and paying fixed on a longer-term swap. This position benefits if the yield curve flattens (i.e., long-term rates fall or short-term rates rise relative to each other).

### Example:

- **Short leg:** 2-year swap (pay fixed)
- **Long leg:** 10-year swap (receive fixed)

In a steepener:
- You pay the fixed rate on a 2-year swap.
- You receive the fixed rate on a 10-year swap.
  
If the yield curve steepens (10-year rates rise more than 2-year rates), the value of the 10-year swap will increase relative to the 2-year swap, resulting in a profit.

In a flattener:
- You receive the fixed rate on a 2-year swap.
- You pay the fixed rate on a 10-year swap.

If the yield curve flattens (2-year rates rise or 10-year rates fall), the value of the 2-year swap will increase relative to the 10-year swap, resulting in a profit.

### Key Concepts:

- **Yield Curve:** A graphical representation of interest rates across different maturities.
- **Interest Rate Swap (IRS):** A financial derivative where two parties exchange cash flows based on different interest rates.
- **Maturity:** The length of time until the final payment of the swap.
- **Fixed Rate:** The set interest rate exchanged in the swap.

By employing these strategies, traders and investors can manage interest rate risk, speculate on future movements of the yield curve, and potentially profit from changes in interest rate environments.
