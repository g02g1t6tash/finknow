Zero-coupon inflation-linked bonds are called "zero-coupon" because they do not pay periodic interest or coupons. Instead, these bonds are issued at a discount to their face value and mature at their full face value. The difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity represents the investor's return. 

Here are the key features of zero-coupon bonds and why they are termed as such:

1. **No Periodic Interest Payments**: Unlike regular bonds, zero-coupon bonds do not make periodic interest payments. This is why they are referred to as "zero-coupon."

2. **Discounted Issuance**: These bonds are sold at a price lower than their face (par) value. The investor's return is realized at maturity when the bond is redeemed for its full face value.

3. **Compounding Interest**: The interest effectively accumulates over the life of the bond and is paid out at maturity. This accumulation of interest without periodic payments aligns with the "zero-coupon" concept.

4. **Inflation Adjustment**: For zero-coupon inflation-linked bonds, the principal is adjusted for inflation over the bond's life. The adjustment ensures that the bondholder's return maintains its purchasing power, protecting against inflation.

By combining the features of zero-coupon bonds with inflation adjustments, these instruments provide a way to secure inflation-protected returns without the need for periodic interest payments.
